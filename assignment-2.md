# Short Notes on Key Concepts

- **API:**  
  An Application Programming Interface allows different software systems to communicate by defining rules and protocols for interaction.

- **SDK:**  
  A Software Development Kit provides tools, libraries, and documentation to help developers create applications for a specific platform or technology.

- **Web APIs:**  
  Web APIs are interfaces for interacting with web-based services, using protocols like HTTP for communication.

- **Library APIs:**  
  Library APIs provide pre-written code functions for developers to reuse in their applications, simplifying development tasks.

- **Prompting and Completion:**  
  Prompting involves providing input to an AI model, while completion is the modelâ€™s generated response based on the input context.
